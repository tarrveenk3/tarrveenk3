- 👋 Hi there! I'm Tarrveen - a student of Computer Science (specialising in Internet of things and Smart Cities), a @Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, a practicing Acupressure and Acupuncture therapist working with @ISA and an amateur writer.

- 🌈 I love music, reading, yoga, traveling, learning about different cultures, meeting new people and making friends. I'm very passionate about writing and expressing myself in a way that reaches out to people and resonates with them, and I try creating an impact with the work I put out in the world.

- 💫 I've been programming since 2011, and usually play around with C++, Java, HTML and CSS. I've been writing since 2015 and its almost a meditative hobby. In the last couple years I've worked with clubs and chapters in my university as an event head and editor.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Machine Learning, Computer Architecture and Integration of IoT in Healthcare.

- 🍨 I can speak fluently in both English and Hindi. (And a broken mix of both)

- 🌐 I’m looking to collaborate on a software development project that would integrate remote sensing with ML to detect natural disasters.
